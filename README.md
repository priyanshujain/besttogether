# Best Together

We are an online community driven support group to help people during COVID pandemic.


In an effort to help people during COVID crisis who are feeling stressed and lonely we are starting BestTogether, a community driven online support group.


During these time, we want to focus not only on managing our stress and anxiety, but also on finding our resilience and hope through joy, laughter, and community. No one should suffer alone during this time, that why you invited to come join our support group.
